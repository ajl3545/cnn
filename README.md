New Approach to CNN

## Setup
pip install matplotlib \
pip install numpy \
pip install python_mnist

## Problem
As we know it, there is only one reliable appraoch to training a CNN. That is, by using back propogation. This process complicates the network, requires massive amounts of training data, and takes large time intervals to train. This network proposes to minimize these issues and learn by using a new approach.
